== Spring Cloud Release Tools

Spring Cloud projects reuse the same pattern of building and deploying the applications. That's
why this tool makes it easy to automate the release / dependency update process of our applications.

=== What does it do?

- Clones the Spring Cloud Release project and picks all versions (Boot + Cloud projects)
- Modifies the project versions with values from SC-Release
  * throws an exception when we bump versions to release and there's a SNAPSHOT version referenced in the POM
- Performs the build and checks if the `docs` modules have properly created the documentation
  * throws an exception when in the `docs` module there's an unresolved tag in any HTML file
- Commits changed poms (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Creates a tag for the release / milestone (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Runs the deployment of the artifacts
- Publishes the docs (to `spring-cloud-static` for non-snapshots, to `gh-pages` for snapshots)
- Reverts back to snapshots, bumps the version by a patch (`1.0.1.RELEASE` -> `1.0.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`) (ONLY FOR RELEASE VERSIONS)
- Closes the milestone on Github (e.g. `v1.0.1.RELEASE`) (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Generates an email template under `target/email.txt` (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Generates a blog template under `target/blog.md` (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)

=== How to run it

Currently we only support running the Releaser to update the poms from Java

Go to your project (e.g. Spring Cloud Sleuth)

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth.git
$ cd spring-cloud-sleuth
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/cloud/internal/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar -O spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
$ java -jar spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
----

The application will start running from your working directory.

TIP:  It is important that you clone the repository you are going to release using SSH in order for the
`releaser` to be able to push tags and commit changes automatically.

You will see text similar to this one

[source]
----
=== WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? ===

0) Perform a full release of this project without interruptions
1) Perform a full release of this project in a verbose mode (you'll be asked about skipping steps)
2) Update poms with versions from Spring Cloud Release
3) Build the project
4) Commit, tag and push the tag
5) Deploy the artifacts to Artifactory
6) Publish the docs
7) Go back to snapshots and bump originalVersion by patch
8) Push the commits
9) Close the milestone at Github
10) Create email / tweet etc. templates


You can press 'q' to quit
----

Just pick a number and continue! Pick either a full release or single steps.

TIP: Read before picking a number cause it might have changed between tool releases ;)

=== Project options

- `releaser.fixed-versions` - A String to String mapping of manually set versions. E.g. `"spring-cloud-cli" -> "1.0.0.RELEASE"` will set
the `spring-cloud-cli.version` to `1.0.0.RELEASE` regardless of what was set in `spring-cloud-release` project
- `releaser.git.clone-destination-dir` - Where should the Spring Cloud Release repo get cloned to. If null defaults to a temporary directory
- `releaser.git.spring-cloud-release-git-url` - URL to Spring Cloud Release Git repository. Defaults to `https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-release`
- `releaser.git.oauth-token` - GitHub OAuth token to be used to interact with GitHub repo.
- `releaser.maven.build-command` - Command to be executed to build the project. Defaults to `./mvnw clean install -Pdocs`
- `releaser.maven.deploy-command` - Command to be executed to deploy a built project". Defaults to `./mvnw deploy -DskipTests -Pfast`
- `releaser.maven.publish-docs-commands` - Command to be executed to deploy a built project. If present `{{version}}` will be replaced by the proper version.
Defaults to the standard Spring Cloud wget and execution of ghpages.
- `releaser.maven.wait-time-in-minutes` - Max wait time in minutes for the process to finish. Defaults to `20`
- `releaser.pom.branch` - Which branch of Spring Cloud Release should be checked out. Defaults to "master",
- `releaser.pom.ignored-pom-regex` - List of regular expressions of ignored poms. Defaults to test projects and samples.,
- `releaser.working-dir` - By default Releaser assumes running the program from the current working directory.

TIP: You can pass the options either via system properties or via application arguments.
Example for system properties: `java -Dreleaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6 -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar`
Example for application argumemts: `java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6`

=== Examples

==== Keeping configuration in the project

If your project has some custom configuration (e.g. Spring Cloud Contract needs a script to be executed
to build the project and properly merge the docs) then you can put a file named e.g. `releaser.yml` under `config`
folder and run your application like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/cloud/internal/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar -O ../spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --spring.config.name=releaser
----

TIP: Notice that we're downloading the jar to a parent folder, not to `target`. That's because `target` get cleaned
during the build process

==== Specifying A Branch

By deafult the releaser will default to using the `master` branch of `spring-cloud-release`.
If you would like to use another branch you can specify it using the `releaser.pom.branch` property.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6
----

==== Using Environment Variables

In some cases it might be easier to specify environment variables instead of passing parameters to
`releaser`.  For example, you might want to use environment variables if you are going to be
releasing multiple projects, this keeps you from having to specify the same parameters for
each release

[source,bash]
----
$ export RELEASER_POM_BRANCH=Dalston.RELEASE
$ export RELEASER_GIT_OAUTH_TOKEN=...
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/cloud/internal/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar -O spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.working-dir=/path/to/project/root
